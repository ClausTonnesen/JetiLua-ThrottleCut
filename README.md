# JetiLua-ThrottleCut
Throttle cut for electric motors This Lua script combines a 'safety switch' and a check of throttle control being in idle position before releasing the throttle cut.
Release 1.02 tested on DS14/16 and 24.
You only need to download the ThrotCut.lc file and of course the instructions in the PDF.
Use at own risk.
